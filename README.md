# Publisher-Subscriber Pattern

This repository showcases an implementation of the Publisher-Subscriber design pattern.

## Overview

The Publisher-Subscriber pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a one-to-many dependency between objects. In this pattern, multiple subscribers (listeners or observers) are registered to a publisher (subject or event source) to receive notifications about changes or events.

This project demonstrates the implementation of this pattern in [Language/Technology] using [Framework/Libraries].

## Features

- **Publisher:** Manages and sends notifications to subscribers.
- **Subscriber:** Receives and handles notifications sent by the publisher.
- **Event Handling:** Demonstrates the flow of events and their propagation to subscribers.
